# runningclub-deventer
My first responsive website for an imaginative running group. I’ve used CSS flexbox and a bit of CSS Grid to set it up.

## Idea
This page was made as a ‘challenge project’ for the front-end engineer path of Codecademy. The assignment was to build a responsive website for a club group using relative units, percentages and media queries.

## Approach
I decided to build a website for a running group that does not exist (yet) in Deventer. CSS flexbox was used to set up the page and one section uses CSS grid. Next to that there are several media query break points.

## Challenges
My first version of this website was responsive, but the use of many breaking points meant that transitions were not fluid. In the second version of this website I have used more relative size units and percentages to indicate width/heights etc. This highly improved the transitions.

## Room to improve
Many illustrations used for the page are relatively large. To improve the loading time of the website these can be made smaller. Next to that the site still has room to improve aesthetically.
